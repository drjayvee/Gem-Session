    \   ''https://api.affixapi.com/2023-03-01/developer/employees'' ```  # Webhooks
    An exciting feature for HR/Payroll modes are webhooks.  If enabled, your `webhook_uri`
    is set on your `client_id` for the respective environment: `dev | prod`  Webhooks
    are configured to make live requests to the underlying integration 1x/hr, and
    if a difference is detected since the last request, we will send a request to
    your `webhook_uri` with this shape:  ``` {    added: <api.v20230301.Employees>[     <api.v20230301.Employee>{       ...,       date_of_birth:
    ''2010-08-06'',       display_full_name: ''Daija Rogahn'',       employee_number:
    ''57993'',       employment_status: ''pending'',       employment_type: ''other'',       employments:
    [         {           currency: ''eur'',           effective_date: ''2022-02-25'',           employment_type:
    ''other'',           job_title: ''Dynamic Implementation Manager'',           pay_frequency:
    ''semimonthly'',           pay_period: ''YEAR'',           pay_rate: 96000,         },       ],       first_name:
    ''Daija'',       ...     }   ],   removed: [],   updated: [     <api.v20230301.Employee>{       ...,       date_of_birth:
    ''2009-11-09'',       display_full_name: ''Lourdes Stiedemann'',       employee_number:
    ''63189'',       employment_status: ''leave'',       employment_type: ''full_time'',       employments:
    [         {           currency: ''gbp'',           effective_date: ''2023-01-16'',           employment_type:
    ''full_time'',           job_title: ''Forward Brand Planner'',           pay_frequency:
    ''semimonthly'',           pay_period: ''YEAR'',           pay_rate: 86000,         },       ],       first_name:
    ''Lourdes'',     }   ] } ```  the following headers will be sent with webhook
    requests:  ``` x-affix-api-signature: ab8474e609db95d5df3adc39ea3add7a7544bd215c5c520a30a650ae93a2fba7  x-affix-api-origin:  webhooks-employees-webhook  user-agent:  affixapi.com
    ```  Before trusting the payload, you should sign the payload and verify the signature
    matches the signature sent by the `affixapi.com` service.  This secures that the
    data sent to your `webhook_uri` is from the `affixapi.com` server.  The signature
    is created by combining the signing secret (your `client_secret`) with the body
    of the request sent using a standard HMAC-SHA256 keyed hash.  The signature can
    be created via:   - create an `HMAC` with your `client_secret`   - update the
    `HMAC` with the payload   - get the hex digest -> this is the signature  Sample
    `typescript` code that follows this recipe:  ``` import { createHmac } from ''crypto'';  export
    const computeSignature = ({   str,   signingSecret, }: {   signingSecret: string;   str:
    string; }): string => {   const hmac = createHmac(''sha256'', signingSecret);   hmac.update(str);   const
    signature = hmac.digest(''hex'');    return signature; }; ```  ## Rate limits
    Open endpoints (not gated by an API key) (applied at endpoint level):   - 15 requests
    every 1 minute (by IP address)   - 25 requests every 5 minutes (by IP address)  Gated
    endpoints (require an API key) (applied at endpoint level):   - 40 requests every
    1 minute (by IP address)   - 40 requests every 5 minutes (by `client_id`)  Things
    to keep in mind:   - Open endpoints (not gated by an API key) will likely be called
    by your     users, not you, so rate limits generally would not apply to you.   -
    As a developer, rate limits are applied at the endpoint granularity.     - For
    example, say the rate limits below are 10 requests per minute by ip.       from
    that same ip, within 1 minute, you get:       - 10 requests per minute on `/orders`,       -
    another 10 requests per minute on `/items`,       - and another 10 requests per
    minute on `/identity`,       - for a total of 30 requests per minute. '

branch-name:
  description: |2
      branch-name is a gem that provides a command-line interface that allows you to accomplish several tasks, tasks I personally find myself having to carry out every time I work on a feature branch. I created this gem for myself; however, you are free to use it yourself, if any of these tasks fits into your personal routine:

      1. Formulate a git feature branch name, given a jira ticket and jira ticket description. Why? Because I am constantly having to create git feature branch names that are based on jira ticket and jira ticket descriptions.
      2. Optionally create a "project" based on the branch name (formulated in step 1 above). Why? Because I'm constantly having to create folders to manage files associated with the feature branches I am working on.
      3. Optionally use and manage default options that determine the git feature branch name formulated, project greated, and default files associated with the project.Why? Because I routinely have to create files to support the feature I am working on and associate them with the feature I am working on. For example: scratch.rb to hold scratch code, snippets.rb to hold code to execute to perform redundant tasks, and readme.txt files to document things I need to remember.

    Different from tools like Scons and Blade, Canoe requires users to write NO building scripts, Canoe would analyze dependencies and build like our old friend 'make' if a few conventions over file names are followed.

cruft_tracker:
  description: |
    Have you ever asked yourself, "Is this method even being used?!" Or, "What the heck is this method receiving?" Does your application use Rails? If the answers these questions are yes, this gem may be of use to you!

    Large applications can accrue cruft; old methods that might once have been important, but are now unused or code that is difficult to understand, but dangerous to refactor. Unfortunately, software is _complex_ and sometimes it's unclear what's really going on. This adds maintenance burdens, headaches, and uncertainty.

    This gem aims to give you a couple tools to make it easier to know what (and how) your code is being used (or not).

    CruftTracker supports Rails versions 5.2 to 6.1 at this time. As of now the gem only supports MySQL, but contributions for Postgres or other DBMS would be welcome.

deco_lite:
  description: |2
        DecoLite is a little gem that allows you to use the provided DecoLite::Model

        class directly, or inherit from the DecoLite::Model class to create your own
        unique subclasses with custom functionality. DecoLite::Model
        includes ActiveModel::Model, so validation can be applied using ActiveModel
        validation helpers (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations/HelperMethods.html)
        you're familiar with; or, you can roll your own - just like any other ActiveModel.

        DecoLite::Model allows you to consume a Ruby Hash that you supply via the
        initializer (DecoLite::Model#new) or via the DecoLite::Model#load! method. Any
        number of Ruby Hashes can be consumed. Your supplied Ruby Hashes are used to
        create attr_accessor attributes (or "fields") on the model. Each attribute
        created is then assigned the value from the Hash that was loaded. Again, any
        number of hashes can be consumed using the DecoLite::Model#load! method.

fat_table:
  description: |2
        FatTable is a gem that treats tables as a data type. It provides methods for
        constructing tables from a variety of sources, building them row-by-row,
        extracting rows, columns, and cells, and performing aggregate operations on
        columns. It also provides as set of SQL-esque methods for manipulating table
        objects: select for filtering by columns or for creating new columns, where
        for filtering by rows, order_by for sorting rows, distinct for eliminating
        duplicate rows, group_by for aggregating multiple rows into single rows and
        applying column aggregate methods to ungrouped columns, a collection of join
        methods for combining tables, and more.

        Furthermore, FatTable provides methods for formatting tables and producing
        output that targets various output media: text, ANSI terminals, ruby data
        structures, LaTeX tables, Emacs org-mode tables, and more. The formatting
        methods can specify cell formatting in a way that is uniform across all the
        output methods and can also decorate the output with any number of footers,
        including group footers. FatTable applies formatting directives to the extent
        they makes sense for the output medium and treats other formatting directives as
        no-ops.

        FatTable can be used to perform operations on data that are naturally best
        conceived of as tables, which in my experience is quite often. It can also serve
        as a foundation for providing reporting functions where flexibility about the
        output medium can be quite useful. Finally FatTable can be used within Emacs
        org-mode files in code blocks targeting the Ruby language. Org mode tables are

    - No need to pre-install any prerequisites. Just install the gem and have cross-platform
    native GUI that just works on Mac, Windows, and Linux! Glimmer DSL for LibUI aims
    to provide declarative DSL syntax that visually maps to GUI control hierarchy,
    convention over configuration via smart defaults, automation of low-level details,
    requiring the least amount of syntax possible to build GUI, bidirectional data-binding,
    custom control/window support, and application/gem/window/control scaffolding.

glimmer-dsl-swt:
  description: Glimmer DSL for SWT (JRuby Desktop Development Cross-Platform Native
    GUI Framework) is a native-GUI cross-platform desktop development library written
    in JRuby, an OS-threaded faster JVM version of Ruby. It includes SWT 4.30 (released
    on December 1, 2023). Glimmer's main innovation is a declarative Ruby DSL that
    enables productive and efficient authoring of professional-grade desktop applications
    by relying on the robust Eclipse SWT library, with the familiar native look, feel,
    and behavior of GUI on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Glimmer additionally innovates
    by having built-in data-binding support, which greatly facilitates synchronizing
    the GUI with domain models, thus achieving true decoupling of object oriented
    components and enabling developers to solve business problems (test-first) without
    worrying about GUI concerns, or alternatively drive development GUI-first, and
    then write clean business models (test-first) afterwards. Not only does Glimmer
    provide a large set of GUI widgets, but it also supports drawing Canvas Graphics
    like Shapes and Animations. To get started quickly, Glimmer offers scaffolding
    options for Apps, Gems, and Custom Widgets. Glimmer also includes native-executable
    packaging support, sorely lacking in other libraries, thus enabling the delivery
    of desktop apps written in Ruby as truly native DMG/PKG/APP files on the Mac,
    MSI/EXE files on Windows, and DEB/RPM files on Linux. Glimmer was the first Ruby
    gem to bring SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit) to Ruby, thanks to creator Andy Maleh,
    EclipseCon/EclipseWorld/RubyConf speaker. If you liked Shoes, You'll love Glimmer!

glimmer-dsl-web:
  description: Glimmer DSL for Web (Ruby in the Browser Web Frontend Framework) enables
    building Web Frontends using Ruby in the Browser, as per Matz's recommendation
    in his RubyConf 2022 keynote speech to replace JavaScript with Ruby. It aims at
    providing the simplest, most intuitive, most straight-forward, and most productive
    frontend framework in existence. The framework follows the Ruby way (with DSLs
    and TIMTOWTDI) and the Rails way (Convention over Configuration) in building Isomorphic
    Ruby on Rails Applications. It provides a Ruby HTML DSL, which uniquely enables
    writing both structure code and logic code in one language. It supports both Unidirectional
    (One-Way) Data-Binding (using <=) and Bidirectional (Two-Way) Data-Binding (using
    <=>). Dynamic rendering (and re-rendering) of HTML content is also supported via
    Content Data-Binding. Modular design is supported with Glimmer Web Components,
    Component Slots, and Component Custom Event Listeners. And, a Ruby CSS DSL is
    supported with the included Glimmer DSL for CSS. Many samples are demonstrated
    in the Rails sample app (there is a very minimal Standalone [No Rails] sample
    app too). You can finally live in pure Rubyland on the Web in both the frontend
    and backend with Glimmer DSL for Web! This gem relies on Opal Ruby.

minitest-distributed:
  description: |
    minitest-distributed is a plugin for minitest for executing tests on a
    distributed set of unreliable workers.

    When a test suite grows large enough, it inevitable gets too slow to run
    on a single machine to give timely feedback to developers. This plugins
    combats this issue by distributing the full test suite to a set of workers.
    Every worker is a consuming from a single queue, so the tests get evenly
    distributed and all workers will finish around the same time. Redis is used
    as coordinator, but when using this plugin without having access to Redis,
    it will use an in-memory coordinator.

    Using multiple (virtual) machines for a test run is an (additional) source
    of flakiness. To combat flakiness, minitest-distributed implements resiliency
    patterns, like re-running a test on a different worker on failure, and
    a circuit breaker for misbehaving workers.

        That common tool with a single method was a Net::HTTP wrapper -- that's where the name from.
        Then when the third script appeared two of them had to pass the Basic Auth.
        The verb POST was added and common logging format, and relatively complex retry logic.
        Then some website had redirects and I had to store cookies, then GZIP and API rate limits...

        I was not going to gemify this monster but it is now a dependency in many other gems,
        and since Gemfile does not support Github dependencies I have to finally gemify it.

puts_debuggerer:
  description: |
    Debuggers are great! They help us troubleshoot complicated programming problems by inspecting values produced by code, line by line. They are invaluable when trying to understand what is going on in a large application composed of thousands or millions of lines of code.
    In day-to-day test-driven development and simple debugging though, a puts statement can be a lot quicker in revealing what is going on than halting execution completely just to inspect a single value or a few. This is certainly true when writing the simplest possible code that could possibly work, and running a test every few seconds or minutes. Problem is you need to locate puts statements in large output logs, know which file names, line numbers, classes, and methods contained the puts statements, find out what variable names are being printed, and see nicely formatted output. Enter puts_debuggerer. A guilt-free puts debugging Ruby gem FTW that prints file names, line numbers, class names, method names, and code statements; and formats output nicely courtesy of awesome_print.

    |> Distributed locks with "prioritized lock acquisition queue" capabilities based on the Redis Database.
    |> Each lock request is put into the request queue (each lock is hosted by it's own queue separately from other queues) and processed in order of their priority (FIFO).
    |> Each lock request lives some period of time (RTTL) (with requeue capabilities) which guarantees the request queue will never be stacked.
    |> In addition to the classic `queued` (FIFO) strategy RQL supports `random` (RANDOM) lock obtaining strategy when any acquirer from the lock queue can obtain the lock regardless the position in the queue.
    |> Provides flexible invocation flow, parametrized limits (lock request ttl, lock ttl, queue ttl, lock attempts limit, fast failing, etc), logging and instrumentation.

rodauth:
  description: |
    Rodauth is Ruby's most advanced authentication framework, designed
    to work in all rack applications.  It's built using Roda and Sequel,
    but it can be used as middleware in front of web applications that use
    other web frameworks and database libraries.

    Rodauth aims to provide strong security for password storage by
    utilizing separate database accounts if possible on PostgreSQL,
    MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.  Configuration is done via
    a DSL that makes it easy to override any part of the authentication
    process.

    Rodauth supports typical authentication features: such as login and
    logout, changing logins and passwords, and creating, verifying,
    unlocking, and resetting passwords for accounts.  Rodauth also
    supports many advanced authentication features:

    * Secure password storage using security definer database functions
    * Multiple primary multifactor authentication methods (WebAuthn and
      TOTP), as well as backup multifactor authentication methods (SMS
      and recovery codes).
    * Passwordless authentication using email links and WebAuthn
      authenticators.
    * Both standard HTML form and JSON API support for all features.

  description: In the last few years digital currencies have successfully demonstrated
    their ability to become an alternative financial instrument in many different
    markets. Most of the technologies available at the moment are based on the principles
    of Blockchain architecture, including dominating currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
    Despite its popularity, Blockchain is not the best possible solution for all scenarios.
    One such example is for fast micro-payments. Zold is an experimental alternative
    that enables distributed transactions between anonymous users, making micro-payments
    financially feasible. It borrows the proof-of-work principle from Bitcoin, and
    suggests a different architecture for digital wallet maintenance.
